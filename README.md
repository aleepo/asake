## Asake 

A really simple and rudimentary way of getting some pixels on the screen specifically for windows using the win32 API. It is also a good ground(ish) work for a software renderer.

### Demo
![Asake Demo](.\doc\demo.png)

### Building
Make sure you have MSVC installed and you can use the compiler from the command prompt. Running `vcvarsall` before attempting to compile covers all you need.
Next is to run `.\build.bat` then run the executable `.\bin\asake_debug.exe` .

You should get a window like the demo. Also you can use `Ctrl+Q` to close the window (That should be a standard for all application).
